## Project Overview / Story
We examined the number of parks in a city from the Trust for Public Land and related it to the specific Health Conditions'statistics documented based on populations in those cities by the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
Study: 
Year: 2017
100 USA Cities
Health conditions:
    Obesity. Age Group Adults >=18 years
    Mental Health not good for >=14 days. Age Group Adults >=18 years 
    Visits to Doctor for Routine Check-ups.  Age Group Adults >=18 years

Hypothesis: Cities ranking higher in city green spaces have a lower:
1.	obesity rate, 
2.	mental health conditions, and 
3.	adhere to regular health check-ups.

## Technical Details: 
The aim of this project is to combine the skills acquired in different programming languages and storytelling skills to create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard includes different visualizations representing the data gathered, cleaned, and analyzed to illustrate the impacts of health as it relates to available and accessible outdoor green spaces.
Programs Used
SQL alchemy was used to clean the datasets
SQL was used to create a database with the cvs files with the data utilized and to show that it ran properly (screenshots attached).
CSS was used to style our HTML document
HTML/json was used to create the interactive dashboard and visualizations for the project using d3 and leaftlet

Project Title: Green Space availability and – Obesity – Mental Health – routine Dr. check-ups

Team Members: 
Gabriela D. Salazar, Kent Andrews, Noah Shore, Naseema Omer 
Project Description / Outline:  
Create Visualizations using specific data to illustrate the impacts of health as it relates to available and accessible outdoor green spaces. 
Hypothesis / Research Questions to Answer:
Hypothesis: Cities ranking higher in city green spaces have a lower:
1.	obesity rate, 
2.	mental health conditions, and 
3.	adhere to regular health check-ups. 
Datasets to be used: 
1.	Green Spaces (City Parks): https://www.tpl.org/park-data-downloads
https://parkserve.tpl.org/downloads/historic/2017_ParkScoreRank.pdf
The parks data has a downloadable zip file that contains excel sheets with the acreage data that we will be using.
2.	Routine Check-up, etc. https://data.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/500-Cities-Visits-to-doctor-for-routine-checkup-wi/2q6t-jyye

3.	Obesity: https://data.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/500-Cities-Obesity-among-adults-aged-18-years/bjvu-3y7d
